----  Ninject integration for WebApi 2  --------
Add Ninject.Web.WebApi using nuget to your Web Api project.

That will install two other package dependencies:
Ninject
Ninject.Web.Common

To make everything work you need to add one more nuget package
Ninject.Web.Common.WebHost

This will pull down the WebActivatorEx package and add a new class called NinjectWebCommon to your App_Start directory.
